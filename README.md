# Weather Application using OpenWeatherMap API

- This is a Weather Application made using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
- We aim to learn the usage and implementation of JavaScript with an integrated API to fetch real-time data about the current weather in a particular city, state, or country, along with the current date and time in that region.
- We use JavaScript for DOM manipulation to make the webpage dynamic, allowing the HTML content to update based on the location input.
- We plan to expand on this basic API wrapper implementation with additional features.

## Future Features

- **AQI Value Checking**
  - **Use Case**: During Diwali, cities like Delhi experience high AQI levels, resulting in severe air pollution that harms those commuting to work. By providing prior knowledge of the AQI in their locality, users can reduce health risks.

- **Card-based Interactive UI and Enhanced UX**
  - **Use Case**: An interactive UI and improved UX enhance the user experience, making the app more engaging and helpful, and attracting a larger, more consistent user base.

We aim to add unique features to our project to make it stand out, creating a successful, engaging, and educational experience.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project.

Yours truly,  
**Group 9**
